# What is this?
This is a repository containing scripts that compile Aseprite and do post-install setup (`.desktop` file)

# How do I use it?
Clone this repo into your `$HOME`. Do not place the repo directory anywhere else or the script and .desktop file will break.
Run the `install.sh` script in the `scripts/` folder. You ***MUST*** run the file while in the scripts folder If you clone the repo into `~/aseprite-resources`, the scripts folder is in `~/aseprite-resources/scripts` and should be ran with `cd ~/aseprite-resources/scripts && ./install.sh`.
