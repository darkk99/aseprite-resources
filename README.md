This is a repository containing scripts that compile Aseprite and do post-install setup (`.desktop` file)

# How do I use it?
Clone this repo into your `$HOME`. Do not place the repo directory anywhere else or the script and .desktop file will break.
Run the `install.sh` script in the `scripts/` folder.
